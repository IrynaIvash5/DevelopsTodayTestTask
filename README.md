# Nuxt Minimal Starter
This application allows users to:

Search for countries by their name.
View three random countries and information about their next holiday.
Get details about holidays in the selected country for the chosen year.

Application Architecture
The application is built using Nuxt.js and utilizes Vue Router for routing. Styling is done with Sass. The main components of the application include:

Home Page: contains a form for searching countries and a block for random countries.
Country Page: displays holiday details for the selected country.
Additional Libraries and Frameworks
Nuxt.js: A framework for creating universal Vue.js applications.
Vue Router: A router for Vue.js that allows navigation between different pages of the application.
Sass: A CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of standard CSS.
